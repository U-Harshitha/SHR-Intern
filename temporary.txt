Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.
Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.
Tonight, we meet as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. But most importantly, as Americans.
With the resolve and resources of America, we are stronger than we were a year ago. And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.
This is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. And we will, as one people. One America.

I want to say thank you to Justice Stephen Breyer for his service. And I am proud to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

Our economy is roaring back. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in decades. We are creating jobs at a record pace. But we need to do more to ensure that all Americans can share in this prosperity. That means investing in infrastructure, education, and clean energy.

We are making historic investments in our infrastructure. From rebuilding roads and bridges to expanding broadband access in rural areas. These investments will create jobs, strengthen our economy, and improve the quality of life for all Americans.

Education is the foundation of our future. We need to make sure every child has access to quality education, from preschool to college. That’s why we are increasing funding for public schools and making community college free for all Americans.

Climate change is an existential threat. We must take bold action to combat it. We are rejoining the Paris Agreement, investing in renewable energy, and setting ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to leave them a planet that is safe and sustainable.

Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. We are working to expand access to affordable healthcare for all Americans. We are lowering prescription drug prices, expanding Medicaid, and protecting those with pre-existing conditions.

Gun violence is a public health crisis. We need common-sense gun reforms to keep our communities safe. That means universal background checks, banning assault weapons, and closing loopholes in our gun laws.

Our democracy is under threat. We must protect the right to vote and ensure that every vote is counted. We are passing legislation to make it easier to vote, end gerrymandering, and reduce the influence of money in politics.

We are a nation of immigrants. We need an immigration system that is fair, humane, and orderly. That means providing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, securing our borders, and reforming our asylum process.

We stand with our allies and partners around the world. We are committed to strengthening our alliances, promoting human rights, and defending democracy. We will continue to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.

Thank you, and may God bless America.
